In this project, I used machine learning in an attempt to teach an algorithm to tell a story.

The more epochs that are ran, the closer the algorithm gets to telling an acutal story. However, there are some diminishing returns after a while.
If you are going to run this algorithm, I highly recommend that you use cuda cores and setup the IDe to access them.
